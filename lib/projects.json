These visualizations incorporated deceptive visualization techniques that convinced viewers of their respective messages."

        "description": "We all have different ideas about what makes a recipe great—taste, convenience, healthiness, or a mix of all three. But when people leave reviews online, what factors most influence those ratings? For my DSC 80 final project at UC San Diego, I explored whether the nutritional content of a recipe, like its protein, sugar, or calories, influences how well it’s rated by users. I used two datasets from Food.com containing thousands of recipes and user ratings."

Using Python (Pandas, NumPy, and visualization libraries), I cleaned and analyzed over 45,000 recorded landings to identify trends in geographic distribution, classification types, and changes over time. I also examined data accuracy by comparing “seen” vs. “recorded” events and visualized global meteorite impact sites."
